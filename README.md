# Independent geolocation autocomplete component based on Mapbox

[Mapbox](http://www.mapbox.com) Geo API

Maintained and Developed By: [Localvore Today](http://www.localvoretoday.com)

The component uses mapbox api to autocompelete cities and states without mapbox
maps. It's designed to be extremely light weight and simple to use.

```
## Dependencies

}

<MapboxAutocomplete publicKey='Your Mapbox Public Key'
